# Web-Demos
Using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and more, I have created a space for demos that I have created for learning purposes.


The only demo I have to show is the one shown in the files above. All you need is the HTML file and a browser to try it. Once downloaded, simply right click the file and choose "open with" and click your browser.
