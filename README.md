# Web-Demos
Using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and more, I have created a space for demos that I have created for learning purposes.


The demos I have to show are in the files above. All you need is the HTML file and a browser to try it. Once downloaded, simply right click the file and choose "open with" and click your browser.


I also have another project that is not a demo, called Aviator Flight Plan, more information can be found on that project page: https://github.com/AviatorFlightPlan/AviatorFlightPlan
